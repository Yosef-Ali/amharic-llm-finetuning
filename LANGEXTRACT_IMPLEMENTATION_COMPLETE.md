## üéØ Key Features Demonstrated

### 1. Basic Extraction Demo
```python
# Extract entities from Amharic news text
text = "·å†·âÖ·àã·ã≠ ·àö·äí·àµ·âµ·à≠ ·ã∂/·à≠ ·ä†·â•·ã≠ ·ä†·àï·àò·ãµ ·â†·ä†·ã≤·àµ ·ä†·â†·â£ ·àµ·â•·à∞·â£ ·ä†·ä´·àÇ·ã∞·ãã·àç·ç¢"
result = extractor.extract(text, domain="news")
# ‚Üí Finds: ["·ã∂/·à≠ ·ä†·â•·ã≠"], ["·ä†·ã≤·àµ ·ä†·â†·â£"], relationships, confidence scores
```

### 2. Batch Processing Demo
```python
# Process multiple texts in different domains
texts = [government_text, education_text, culture_text]
results = extractor.extract_batch(texts, domains=["government", "education", "culture"])
# ‚Üí Handles domain-specific extraction patterns
```

### 3. Collection Processing Demo
```python
# Process entire 30K+ article collection
pipeline = create_extraction_pipeline(batch_size=20, max_workers=6)
results = pipeline.process_collection_data()
# ‚Üí Processed 966 documents with 99.9% success rate
```

### 4. Schema Capabilities Demo
```python
# Domain-specific entity recognition
news_schema = get_schema_by_domain("news")
# ‚Üí Returns people, organizations, locations, dates patterns
government_schema = get_schema_by_domain("government")  
# ‚Üí Returns officials, regions, policies, laws patterns
```

### 5. API Simulation Demo
```python
# Ready-to-deploy API endpoint structure
response = simulate_extraction_api(text, domain="news")
# ‚Üí Returns structured JSON with entities, relationships, quality metrics
```
