## Monitoring and Iteration

### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Training Metrics**
   - Loss convergence
   - Gradient norms
   - Learning rate decay
   - Validation perplexity

2. **Quality Metrics**
   - Human evaluation scores
   - Automated benchmarks
   - Cultural safety violations
   - User engagement

3. **System Metrics**
   - Inference latency
   - Throughput (tokens/sec)
   - Memory usage
   - Error rates

### Iteration Strategy
1. Weekly model evaluations
2. Bi-weekly user feedback analysis
